# Sales Prediction using Machine Learning with Walmart Dataset

This project focuses on predicting sales using machine learning techniques, leveraging historical sales data from Walmart. By analyzing past sales patterns and incorporating various features such as date, store information, and promotional activities, this model aims to provide accurate sales forecasts, aiding in inventory management and decision-making processes.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict future sales based on historical data. By accurately forecasting sales, businesses can optimize inventory levels, plan marketing strategies, and allocate resources more effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project comprises historical sales data from Walmart stores. It includes information such as store number, date, holiday events, promotional activities, and weekly sales figures.

### Features

- **Store:** Unique identifier for each Walmart store.
- **Date:** Date of the sales record.
- **Holiday Events:** Indicator for holiday events.
- **Promotional Activities:** Information about promotional activities.
- **Weekly Sales:** Sales figures for the corresponding week.

## Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and feature engineering if required.
2. **Split Data:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
3. **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression tasks such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or Gradient Boosting Regression.
4. **Train Model:** Train the selected model on the training dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the model hyperparameters to optimize performance if necessary.
7. **Prediction:** Make predictions on the testing dataset and assess the model's accuracy.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection:** Obtain the historical sales dataset from Walmart or relevant sources.
2. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributions.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling if required.
4. **Feature Selection:** Select relevant features that contribute to sales prediction.
5. **Model Development:** Develop machine learning models using regression algorithms and train them on the preprocessed data.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the models' performance using appropriate evaluation metrics and fine-tune as necessary.
7. **Prediction:** Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new data or future sales periods.
8. **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Monitor the model's performance over time, retrain periodically with updated data, and make necessary adjustments to ensure accurate predictions.
